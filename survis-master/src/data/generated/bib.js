        "abstract": "This paper explores the use of hyper-heuristics for variable and value ordering in binary Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP). Specifically, we describe the use of a symbolic cognitive architecture, augmented with constraint based reasoning as the hyper-heuristic machine learning framework. The underlying design motivation of our approach is to \"do more with less.\" Specifically, the approach seeks to minimize the number of low level heuristics encoded yet dramatically expand the expressiveness of the hyper-heuristic by encoding the constituent measures of each heuristic, thereby providing more opportunities to achieve improved solutions. Further, the use of a symbolic cognitive architecture allows us to encode hierarchical preferences which extend the effectiveness of the hyper-heuristic across problem types. Empirical experiments are conducted to generate and test hyper-heuristics for two benchmark CSP problem types: Map Coloring; and, Job Shop Scheduling. Results suggest that the hyper-heuristic approach provides a dramatically higher level of representational granularity allowing superior intra-problem and inter-problem solutions to be secured over traditional combinations of variable and value ordering heuristics.",

        "abstract": "Hyper-heuristic is a class of methodologies which automates the process of selecting or generating a set of heuristics to solve various optimization problems. A traditional hyper-heuristic model achieves this through a high-level heuristic that consists of two key components, namely a heuristic selection method and a move acceptance method. The effectiveness of the high-level heuristic is highly problem dependent due to the landscape properties of different problems. Most of the current hyper-heuristic models formulate a high-level heuristic by matching different combinations of components manually. This article proposes a method to automatically design the high-level heuristic of a hyper-heuristic model by utilizing a reinforcement learning technique. More specifically, Q-learning is applied to guide the hyper-heuristic model in selecting the proper components during different stages of the optimization process. The proposed method is evaluated comprehensively using benchmark instances from six problem domains in the Hyper-heuristic Flexible Framework. The experimental results show that the proposed method is comparable with most of the top-performing hyper-heuristic models in the current literature.",

        "abstract": "\u2022A review of contemporary literature of selection hyper-heuristics is given.\u2022The existing classification of selection hyper-heuristics is extended.\u2022Frameworks designed for hyper-heuristic development are discussed.\u2022Critical discussion, current trends and directions for future research are included. Hyper-heuristics have emerged as a way to raise the level of generality of search techniques for computational search problems. This is in contrast to many approaches, which represent customised methods for a single problem domain or a narrow class of problem instances. The term hyper-heuristic was defined in the early 2000s as a heuristic to choose heuristics, but the idea of designing high-level heuristic methodologies can be traced back to the early 1960s. The current state-of-the-art in hyper-heuristic research comprises a set of methods that are broadly concerned with intelligently selecting or generating a suitable heuristic for a given situation. Hyper-heuristics can be considered as search methods that operate on lower-level heuristics or heuristic components, and can be categorised into two main classes: heuristic selection and heuristic generation. Here we will focus on the first of these two categories, selection hyper-heuristics. This paper gives a brief history of this emerging area, reviews contemporary selection hyper-heuristic literature, and discusses recent selection hyper-heuristic frameworks. In addition, the existing classification of selection hyper-heuristics is extended, in order to reflect the nature of the challenges faced in contemporary research. Unlike the survey on hyper-heuristics published in 2013, this paper focuses only on selection hyper-heuristics and presents critical discussion, current research trends and directions for future research.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a multi-objective selection hyper-heuristic approach combining Reinforcement Learning, (meta)heuristic selection, and group decision-making as acceptance methods, referred to as Hyper-Heuristic based on Reinforcement LearnIng, Balanced Heuristic Selection and Group Decision AccEptance (HRISE), controlling a set of Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) as Low-Level (meta)Heuristics (LLHs). Along with the use of multiple MOEAs, we believe that having a robust LLH selection method as well as several move acceptance methods at our disposal would lead to an improved general-purpose method producing most adequate solutions to the problem instances across multiple domains. We present two learning hyper-heuristics based on the HRISE framework for multi-objective optimisation, each embedding a group decision-making acceptance method under a different rule: majority rule (HRISE_M) and responsibility rule (HRISE_R). A third hyper-heuristic is also defined where both a random LLH selection and a random move acceptance strategy are used. We also propose two variants of the late acceptance method and a new quality indicator supporting the initialisation of selection hyper-heuristics using low computational budget. An extensive set of experiments were performed using 39 multi-objective problem instances from various domains where 24 are from four different benchmark function classes, and the remaining 15 instances are from four different real-world problems. The cross-domain search performance of the proposed learning hyper-heuristics indeed turned out to be the best, particularly HRISE_R, when compared to three other selection hyper-heuristics, including a recently proposed one, and all low-level MOEAs each run in isolation. \u2022Proposed three selection hyper-heuristics for multi-objective optimisation.\u2022Hyper-heuristics embed reinforcement learning and group decision-making acceptance.\u2022A new quality indicator and two new Late Acceptance variants are presented.\u2022Dynamic control mechanism for running multi-objective evolutionary algorithms.\u2022Best performance across 39 synthetic and real-world multi-objective problem instances.",

        "abstract": "\u2022A hyper-heuristic framework is proposed for online combinatorial optimisation.\u2022A deep reinforcement learning agent is first used in hyper-heuristic.\u2022The method holds better convergence performance than the existing methods.\u2022Our approach improves the interpretability of traditional DRL. In the past decade, considerable advances have been made in the field of computational intelligence and operations research. However, the majority of these optimisation approaches have been developed for deterministically formulated problems, the parameters of which are often assumed perfectly predictable prior to problem-solving. In practice, this strong assumption unfortunately contradicts the reality of many real-world problems which are subject to different levels of uncertainties. The solutions derived from these deterministic approaches can rapidly deteriorate during execution due to the over-optimisation without explicit consideration of the uncertainties. To address this research gap, a deep reinforcement learning based hyper-heuristic framework is proposed in this paper. The proposed approach enhances the existing hyper-heuristics with a powerful data-driven heuristic selection module in the form of deep reinforcement learning on parameter-controlled low-level heuristics, to substantially improve their handling of uncertainties while optimising across various problems. The performance and practicality of the proposed hyper-heuristic approach have been assessed on two combinatorial optimisation problems: a real-world container terminal truck routing problem with uncertain service times and the well-known online 2D strip packing problem. The experimental results demonstrate its superior performance compared to existing solution methods for these problems. Finally, the increased interpretability of the proposed deep reinforcement learning hyper-heuristic has been exhibited in comparison with the conventional deep reinforcement learning methods.",
